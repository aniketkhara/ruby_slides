Create Powerpoint presentations in Ruby with elements like slides, text, images, tables and charts.

## Installation

Optionally use the latest code using:

```

## Getting started


Get started by creating a new object

```ruby
@presentation =  RubySlides::Presentation.new
```

RubySlides offer various types of slide as described below. If you would like
to see an example of a powerpoint generated with RubySlides take a look at the
powerpoint in the example folder. That's the result of running the spec.


### Introduction Slide

```ruby
title = "Hello Universe!"
subtitle = "Powerpoints with ruby"
@presentation.introduction_slide title, subtitle
```

### Textual Slide

```ruby
textual_title = "Textual Slide"
textual_items = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]
@presentation.textual_slide textual_title, textual_items
```

### Pictorial Slide

```ruby
pictorial_title = "Image Slide"
picture_path = "example/ruby.png"
@presentation.pictorial_slide pictorial_title, picture_path
```

### Pictorial with coordinates

                  cx: 80 * 12700, cy: 60 * 12700 }    # Picture Sizing
